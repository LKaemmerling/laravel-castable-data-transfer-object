Laravel is awesome. Spatie's [data transfer object](https://github.com/spatie/data-transfer-object) package for PHP is awesome. They're already good friends, but now they're they're taking their relationship to the next level ðŸ’•

Have you ever wanted to cast your JSON columns to a value object?

This package gives you an extended version of Spatie's `DataTransferObject` class, called `CastableDataTransferObject`.

Under the hood it implements Laravel's [`Castable` interface](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent-mutators#castables) with a Laravel [custom cast](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent-mutators#custom-casts) that handles serializing between the `DataTransferObject` (or a compatible array) and your JSON database column.

Check out the blog post at https://jessarcher.com/blog/casting-json-columns-to-value-objects/

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require jessarcher/laravel-castable-data-transfer-object
```

## Usage

### 1. Create your `CastableDataTransferObject`

Check out the readme for Spatie's [data transfer object](https://github.com/spatie/data-transfer-object) package to find out more about what their `DataTransferObject` class can do.

``` php
namespace App\Values;

use JessArcher\CastableDataTransferObject\CastableDataTransferObject;

class Address extends CastableDataTransferObject
{
    public string $street;
    public string $suburb;
    public string $state;
}
```

(Note: I like to put these in `App\Values` because I'm using them as a value object and not just a plain DTO. Feel free to put it anywhere you like!)

### 2. Configure your Eloquent attribute to cast to it:

Note that this should be a `jsonb` or `json` column in your database schema.

```php
namespace App\Models;

use App\Values\Address;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    protected $casts = [
        'address' => Address::class,
    ];
}
```

And that's it! You can now pass either an instance of your `Address` class, or even just an array with a compatible structure. It will automatically be cast between your class and JSON for storage and the data will be validated on the way in and out.

```php
$user = User::create([
    // ...
    'address' => [
        'street' => '1640 Riverside Drive',
        'suburb' => 'Hill Valley',
        'state' => 'California',
    ],
])

$residents = User::where('address->suburb', 'Hill Valley')->get();
```

But the best part is that you can decorate your class with domain-specific methods to turn it into a powerful value object.

```php
$user->address->toMapUrl();

$user->address->getCoordinates();

$user->address->getPostageCost($sender);

$user->address->calculateDistance($otherUser->address);

echo (string) $user->address;
```

### Testing

``` bash
composer test
```
